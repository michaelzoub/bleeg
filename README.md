## Bleeg is the perfect component for bloggers and twitter users. It summarizes your blog posts and seamlessly posts them on Twitter. Getting Started:

First, run these commands:

```bash
npm run dev 
npm install openai twitter-api-v2
```

## You can use the component folder in your app directly. Make sure to either copy the provided Twitter functionality code if you're running NextJS or modify it for your backend of choice.

## It's preferable to set props when using the component.
